## Rationale for Modeling

No experimental structure of full-length NY-ESO-1 (180 aa) exists in PDB.
Available experimental data limited to:
- PDB 1S9W: Residues 157-165 only (peptide in HLA-A2 complex)
- PDB 1S9Y: Residues 157-165 variant (peptide in HLA-A2 complex)

This model provides:
1. Full-length structural context for NY-ESO-1
2. Visualization of protein domains and epitope regions
3. Structural basis for understanding immunogenicity
4. Context for peptide presentation on MHC molecules

## Validation

### 1. AlphaFold3 Quality Assessment
- pTM score: 0.440 (lower quality)
- Mean pLDDT: 63.15 (low overall confidence)
- Model shows expected disorder: 58% disordered
  (consistent with glycine-rich N-terminus)
- No structural clashes detected [OK]

### 2. Regional Confidence Analysis
- N-terminal region (1-81): Mean pLDDT 39.6
  -> Low-moderate confidence expected for disordered region [OK]
- Pcc-1 domain (82-168): Mean pLDDT 85.0
  -> Higher confidence as expected for structured domain [OK]
- C-terminal region (169-180): Mean pLDDT 63.7
- Confidence gradient consistent with known biochemical properties [OK]

### 3. Epitope Region Quality
- Immunogenic epitope (157-165): Mean pLDDT 88.15
- High confidence supports reliable structural analysis [OK]
- Can be directly compared with experimental structure 1S9W
- Suitable for visualization of epitope presentation context

### 4. Structural Features
- Model reflects known characteristics:
  * Glycine-rich N-terminus: flexible, lower confidence
  * Pcc-1 domain: more structured, higher confidence
  * Small protein size (18 kDa) - no large globular domains expected
- Disorder prediction consistent with literature
- No unexpected structural features

### 5. Comparison Potential
- Epitope region (157-165) can be aligned with PDB 1S9W
- Backbone conformation suitable for comparison
- High enough confidence for comparative structural analysis

## Limitations

- N-terminal region has lower confidence due to intrinsic disorder
  (58% of protein predicted as disordered)
- pTM score of {ptm:.2f} indicates {'good' if ptm > 0.8 else 'moderate'} global structure quality
- Conformations in flexible regions represent one possible state
- No experimental validation for full-length structure exists
- Fine structural details in low-confidence regions may not be accurate

## Suitable Applications

[OK] Epitope mapping and visualization
[OK] Understanding structural context of immunogenic regions
[OK] Designing vaccine constructs
[OK] Comparative analysis with peptide-MHC structures
[OK] Context for reviewing pMHC-TCR interactions
[OK] Illustrating protein domains in review papers

[X] Not suitable for detailed drug design targeting full-length protein
[X] N-terminal region conformations should not be over-interpreted
[X] Quantitative binding predictions not recommended

## Conclusion

Model provides valuable structural context for NY-ESO-1 in the context of 
pMHC-TCR review. Despite moderate overall quality (pTM: {ptm:.2f}, mean pLDDT: 
{mean_plddt:.2f}), the {'high' if epitope_mean and epitope_mean > 85 else 'moderate'} confidence in the immunogenic epitope region (157-165) 
makes this suitable for comparative visualization and structural discussion.
The high fraction of disorder ({fraction_disordered*100:.0f}%) is expected and consistent 
with the known glycine-rich, flexible nature of NY-ESO-1.

Appropriate for inclusion in review papers with clear documentation of 
confidence levels and comparison with experimental peptide-MHC structures.
