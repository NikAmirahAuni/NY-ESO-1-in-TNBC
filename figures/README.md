## ✏️ Figure 1: Schematic Representation of Immunologic Epitopes of NY-ESO-1 and Structure of NY-ESO-1 Peptide Bound to HLA-A2

### Panel A: Immunological Epitope Map of NY-ESO-1
Map of immunological epitopes of NY-ESO-1. The green area is rich in epitopes recognized by antibodies. The naturally occurring anti-NY-ESO-1 antibodies mostly map to this soluble N-terminus region. The purple area, the C-terminus region corresponding to cellular responses, is rich in epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

### Panel B: Crystal Structure of HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ Complex
**PDB ID:** 1S9W  

Crystal structure of NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ (SLLMWITQC) bound to HLA-A2, with key residues labeled. The blue residues are solvent-exposed, while orange residues are buried residues for MHC binding.

### Panel C: Structural Comparison of Peptide Variants
**PDB ID:** 1S9W, 1S9X, 1S9Y  

Structural comparison showing that substitution of Cys9 with Ala9 or Ser9 maintains similar geometry with Met4 and Trp5 forming central bulge for TCR recognition.

## 🖌 Figure 2: NY-ESO-1 Expression During Fetal Development and Functional Roles in Spermatogonial Cells

### NY-ESO-1 Expression Timeline
During fetal development, NY-ESO-1 is expressed starting at week 13, reaching peak levels during second trimester (weeks 22-24), and declining before birth.

### Molecular Function in Spermatogonial Cells
NY-ESO-1 is upregulated in spermatogonial cells, containing Pcc-1 domain located at residues 82-168. This Pcc-1 domain mediates NY-ESO-1 incorporation into the EKC/KEOPS complex via Pcc1p. This molecular interaction suggests NY-ESO-1 may play important roles in transcriptional regulation, influencing spermatogonial differentiation and cell cycle progression. However, as noted, the specific transcriptional targets in human germ cells are unknown and require further investigation.

## 🖍️ Figure 3: Structural Basis of NY-ESO-1 Recognition by TCR, Antibody, and TCR-like Binding Complexes

### Panel A: HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ in Complex with Fab 3M4E5
**PDB ID:** [3HAE]  

Three-dimensional structure of HLA-A2:NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ in complex with Fab 3M4E5, showing heavy chain (orange) and light chain (blue) interactions. Key residues Tyr103 and Glu99 in the Fab interface with the peptide at Met4 and Trp5, serving as central recognition points [54]. Black dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds.

### Panel B: HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ in Complex with 1G4 TCR
**PDB ID:** [2BNQ]  

Structure of HLA-A2:NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ in complex with 1G4 TCR, displaying TCRα (orange) and TCRβ (blue) chains. Similar to Fab recognition, the Tyr100 and Ser93 residues interact with Met4 and Trp5, the key contact points of peptide [54]. Black dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds.

### Panel C: HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ in Complex with TRACeR
**PDB ID:** [9DL1]  

Structure of HLA-A2:NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ in complex with Targeted Recognition of Antigen-MHC Complex Reporter for MHC class I (TRACeR). TRACeR forms extensive contacts across the entire peptide to confer single-residue specificity at the accessible positions (Ser1, Leu2, Leu3, Met4, and Gln8). The hydrophobic pocket (shown in yellow) formed to accommodate Met4 and Trp5 hotspot residues [61]. Black dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds.

### Panel D: HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ in Complex with TCR Mimic (TCRm)
**PDB ID:** [9MIN]  

Crystal structure of HLA-A2:NY-ESO-1₁₅₇₋₁₆₅ in complex with TCR mimic (TCRm). Structural analysis demonstrates a rigid, TCR-like docking mode in which the binder forms a compact, shape-complementary shell around the peptide, particularly MW motif. Key interacting residues of TCRm include Tyr87, Asn80, and Asn54 contact to Met4, Thr7, and Gln8 of the peptide [63]. Black dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds.
